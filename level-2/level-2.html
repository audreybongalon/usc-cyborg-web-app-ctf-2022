            <h2>hack a video game</h2>

            <p>this is meant to teach you how to hack javascript</p>

            <p>depending on what you choose to do, this could be extremely easy but boring, or slightly easy yet fun</p>

            <p>there's a game below. your goal is to win by shooting the other ship down. arrow keys to move, spacebar
            to shoot.</p>

            <p>but there's one problem: the game is really hard. perhaps a bit too hard. maybe even impossible</p>

            <p>so let's hack it!</p>

            <p>the obvious thing to do would be to insta-kill the enemy ship, but that's kinda boring. what other things
            could we do? make our own ship invincible? make our shots do extra damage? increase our cannon's fire rate?
            make the enemy frozen in place? disable the enemy's ability to fire? you decide!</p>

            <p>there's just one thing you need to promise: do not look inside <code>flag.js</code>. we put the script to
            display the flag there so that we didn't need to set up an API server. the downside is that you can just
            read the flag straight from the file. if you do that, you'll still get the flag, but come on. that ruins the
            experience. there's also some sections of code that will tell you that certain things are not allowed.
            please obey those rules (for the same reason). if you dont' you're not learning much that way. plus, this
            challenge is already meant to be easy anyways. so be a good noodle!</p>
