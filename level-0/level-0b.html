            <h2>because the world needed some style</h2>

            <p>fast forward about half a decade, and CSS came along. it didn't instantly fix everything, but it sure
            made things a lot prettier... well, more like <i>capable</i> of being prettier. you still need someone who
            knows good graphic design</p>

        <section>
            <h2>what you need to know (as a hacker)</h2>

            <p>CSS adds style.</p>

            <p>if im gonna be real with you, that's about it. for the most part, you won't be doing a lot with CSS when
            it comes to web app hacking. if you do, it's probably social-engineering related, and most of the time it's
            just making something hidden from view</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <!-- lowercase in the heading, due to the font -->
            <h2>more about css</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>CSS can be written in an external file, inside a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag, or "inline" on
                a tag itself</li>

                <li>there can be multiple CSS files per page</li>

                <li>multiple HTML files can reference the same CSS page. in fact, that's how all of these levels
                maintain a consistent style between them</li>

                <li>CSS can be used to "hide" information from the user. the information can still be found if you read
                the source code though. there's various ways to do this: <code>display: none</code>, <code>visibility:
                hidden</code>, <code>opacity: 0</code>, or even setting the text colour to the same as the background
                colour</li>

                <li>modern CSS can do animations too. some are simple, like changing colour when you hover over a
                button. some are slightly more complicated, like the rainbow button used to progress through these
                levels</li>

                <li>modern CSS also has variables and can do certain kinds of mathematical calculations. if you really
                want to, you can use this to do code obfuscation, but this has limited effectiveness</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>but wait, there<span class="jank">'</span>s moar<span class="jank">!</span></h2>

            <p>for most websites, just HTML and CSS is actually fine, since most websites are primarily just text and
            images. but if you want more user interaction, we need something more...</p>
