            there's actually a little bit of CSS here. you can technically do it with just HTML, but it's an outdated
            syntax. im sure that browsers still support it, but it was just easier to use CSS

            <h1>HTML</h1>
            <p><i>level 0, part a</i></p>
            <p>No, this page isn't broken. It's supposed to look like this.</p>
        </section>

            <h2>Welcome to the web!</h2>

            <p>It's the early 90s. Some people just came up with a wonderful idea: the internet! In its earliest stages,
            the internet was mainly used in research, academia, and the military. So at this point in time, the focus
            was on sharing documents and manuals, not dank memes, cat photos, or social media posts.</p>

            <p>Of course, if we're gonna have a bunch of computers from around the world sharing data, we're gonna need
            those computers to agree on how to communicate that data. And thus, HTML was born. HTML specifies what
            "content" goes on the page. You might notice that everything looks kinda ugly. In fact, you might feel like
            this page looks "broken", or maybe like some kind of sussy scam website. That's because nowadays (2022), not
            many people write websites with <i>just</i> HTML anymore.</p>

            <p>The basic format of HTML is to place content inside "tags", which look like this:<br>
                <code>&lt;p&gt;example of a paragraph&lt;/p&gt;</code><br>
            I'm not going to go into detail, but you can Google more about it if you want.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>What you need to know (as a hacker)</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>HTML can have links. See the section below for more details.</li>

                <li>HTML is "static", meaning whatever you see on the page doesn't change...</li>

                <li>...unless something else modifies the HTML. But the thing making the changes isn't the HTML; it's
                something else</li>

                <li>Your browser automatically renders the HTML page for you. This means that what you see here is not
                the same as the "source code" that the developer wrote. Try to figure out how to view the source code
                for this page. Can you find the secret message?</li>

                <li>On modern web apps, some of the HTML may not necessarily be written by a human. For example, imagine
                a page that says "welcome [username]" after you log in, where "[username]" is replaced with a different
                name for each user. A modern server can send different HTML content based on stuff like the user, time
                of day, what pages you visited before, etc.</li>
            </ol>

            <!--
                yay! you found the secret message!

                in case you dont already know, this is an HTML comment. stuff in comments can only be seen in the source
                code, but the browser will not render it to the user. you're able to view the source code because your
                browser had to download this entire file to be able to render the page in the first place

                now you might be thinking, "hold on. i literally just press [Ctrl + U] on my keyboard and read? that's
                it? this doesnt feel like *real* hacking. real websites dont have secret messages"

                okay, so a real website probably doesnt have a secret message, but there have been some cases where
                people have found sensitive data in the raw HTML. you usually wont be able to hack something this easily
                irl, but it *does* happen every now and then. this isnt a testament to how easy hacking is, so much as
                it is to how some developers know nothing about security

                take a look at these:
                https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/10/viewing-website-html-code-is-not-illegal-or-hacking-prof-tells-missouri-gov/
                https://threatpost.com/missouri-prosecute-hacker-data-leak/175501/

                irl, you wont usually find a full-on list of SSNs, but it's not uncommon find notes that developers
                leave for themselves. usually this just explains what the code does, but occasionally you might find
                API keys or "todo" notes about bugs they havent fixed yet
            -->

            <p>In real life, you don't often "hack" HTML. But the HTML might link to other files that will help you hack
            the web app. Use your browser to check for linked files!</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Modifying HTML</h2>

            <p>Your browser needs to download the entire HTML file so that it can actually display that information onto
            the screen. Did you know that the file is kept in your browser's memory? You can even modify the contents
            to make it look like the page says something else! Keep in mind that this only modifies the file that
            <i>you</i> downloaded. Anyone else who visits the page won't see those modifications, since they get a
            separate copy from the server. Also, your changes will probably go away once you refresh the page.</p>

            <p>Still, it's possible to pull off some kind of social-engineering scheme this way. For example, there are
            some real-life scammers who trick their victims by "hacking" their bank account by modifying the HTML. You
            can see an example <a href="https://youtu.be/HSMPRAn3bjE?t=1309" target="_blank">here</a>. These types of
            scams require access to the victim's browser though, so their effectiveness is limited.</p>

            <p>Either way, it's good to learn, so why not give it a go? Try to modify the content on this page!</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Important info about links</h2>

            <p>HTML lets you link to stuff. You probably already know what links are. For learning how to hack HTML
            links, I'd highly recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ" target="_blank">this</a>
            YouTube tutorial.</p> <!-- trollolololo -->

            <p>It is really important that you understand that HTML can link to things outside of a page's domain. This
            means that <mark>some links may point to pages that are out of scope!</mark> For example, we are letting you
            hack the pages for this CTF, but we aren't allowing you to hack YouTube. Now that's usually obvious when
            you're hacking manually, but it can be easy to forget if you're using a tool or writing a script. ALWAYS
            make sure that a page is within scope before hacking it!</p>

            Some common places to find links within HTML:

            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>tag</th>
                        <th>example</th>
                        <th>notes</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>link tags</td>
                        <td><code>&lt;link href="https://example.com/style.css"&gt;</code></td>
                        <td>not the "normal" kind of link most people think of. the user doesn't usually see these</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>anchor tags</td>
                        <td><code>&lt;a href="https://example.com/webpage.html"&gt;</code></td>
                        <td>this one is the "normal" link</td>
                    </tr><tr>
                        <td>script tags</td>
                        <td><code>&lt;script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.js"&gt;</code></td>
                        <td>used to incorporate javascript files. may or may not be on the same domain</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>images</td>
                        <td><code>&lt;img src="https://en.meming.world/images/en/6/6e/Surprised_Pikachu.jpg"&gt;</code></td>
                        <td>images are separate files from the HTML page</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>iframes</td>
                        <td><code>&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pfkBYHFZAt8"&gt;</code></td>
                        <td>you can embed other webpages within a webpage. this includes YouTube videos</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <h2>HTML limitations</h2>

            <p>HTML was fine for exchanging documents, but it had some obvious drawbacks. Most obviously, graphic design
            was... well, lacking. The most you could really do was create tables and hide the borders, but that got very
            annoying fairly quickly. The web needed something more.</p>
