            hey. did you come back here (from part a) to see if there was anything in the HTML source code? nice job!
            digging around is what hacking is all about!

            unfortunately, this hidden message is all you'll get as a reward. no bonus flag or anything. sorry, but i
            promised that for level 0, i'll just give you the flag and that you can skip to the end, so it'd be unfair
            for me to make others lose out on points for doing exactly what i told them they could

            <h1>web application hacking</h1>
            <p><i>an intro-level CTF</i></p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>overview</h2>

            <p>welcome to the web application portion of the CTF!</p>

            <p>this CTF is geared towards total beginners, so i'll try to keep these challenges as simple as
            possible. web application hacking is such a wide topic that we cant possibly cover everything, but by the
            end of this, you should feel familiar with the basics</p>

            <p>in this portion, we'll cover the basics of HTML, CSS, and javascript, as well as what tools you can use
            for hacking those. your target today will be a very simple web app. in fact, it'll be a bit more simple than
            most modern web apps, but it's meant to keep things relatively easy</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>level 0</h2>

            <p>this level should be really easy. <mark>on the last page of this level, i will literally just give you
            the flag for free</mark>. but i'll also provide some material for you to read over, which will hopefully
            help with the later levels. if you want, you can just skip to the last page and grab your flag, and then
            just come back here if you need it</p>

            <h2>what<span class="jank">'</span>s a web app<span class="jank">?</span></h2>

            <p>tldr: basically a website</p>

            <p>the longer answer is... well... okay so you know what an app is, right? those things on your laptop,
            phone, tablet, etc? just imagine something like that, except you dont have to install it on your device.
            instead, your browser downloads the files, and then it somehow magically works</p>

            <p>you can read stuff, you can click stuff to do a thing, and maybe pressing stuff on your keyboard does
            another thing. woo! so many wonderful possibilities! and you never had to install anything (other than your
            browser), hence why web apps are everywhere! that also means hacking opportunities are everywhere too</p>

            <p>if you try to google the phrase "web app", you'll probably see something about it having to be
            "interactive" and whatnot. in practice though, pretty much every modern website has some level of
            interactivity. there's some other technical differences too, but IMO it's not a big deal</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>how to use a web app</h2>

            <p>just go to the website with your browser. you know, chrome, firefox, safari, microsoft edge (lol why),
            internet explorer, etc</p>

            <p>from there, it all depends on the app. you probably click things, and maybe type things too</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>okay, but how does all of that work<span class="jank">?</span></h2>

            <p>first, you need to understand that there's usually a client and a server. the client is usually a browser
            on a laptop or phone, and the server is usually some company's computer whose sole purpose is to give
            clients files when they ask. in practice, there's usually multiple clients and multiple servers, but we'll
            ignore that for now</p>

            <p>when you (the client, i.e. your browser) visited the webpage, your browser downloaded a file (probably an
            HTML file). usually, that file contains links to other files (fonts, images, scripts, etc), and your browser
            automatically downloads those too. your browser renders all the content, and then executes the scripts. your
            browser now does stuff!</p>

            <p>additionally, your browser might detect you doing certain actions, and send information to the server
            when that happens. the server might respond by sending back more data, and your browser can do more stuff
            based on that data. for example, your browser might detect when you hit the "submit" button on a form, send
            the data to the server, and then the server will send back a different message based on what information you
            entered into the form</p>

            <p>if all of this seems pretty vague, that's because it is. web apps have so many possibilities in what they
            can do. but the important thing to remember is that <mark>some of the stuff happens in your browser, and
            some of the stuff happens on the server</mark>. why is that important? it means you have two environments to
            learn to deal with!</p>

            <p>for this CTF, we'll focus on hacking stuff on the <i>client</i> side. as far as the server goes, it will
            just return whatever files the client asks for. so for the web app portion of this CTF, <mark>attacking the
            server will be considered out of scope</mark>. (That means don't hack it.)</p>

        <section>
            <h2>a brief history of the web</h2>

            <p>personally, i think the best way to understand why web apps work the way they do is by seeing how the web
            evolved over time. so let's go back in history...</p>
