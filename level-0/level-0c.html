            <h2>because the world needed more interactivity</h2>

            <p><span style="text-decoration: line-through">according to wikipedia,</span> javascript was actually
            created a year before CSS, so we actually jumped back through time. unlike HTML or CSS, javascript is a
            full-on programming language. without actually learning all three of these languages, it's hard to explain
            how different they really are</p>

            <p>here's some things you can do with javascript:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>detect where your mouse is</li>
                <li>detect when and where you click on a page</li>
                <li>detect keyboard input</li>
                <li>perform an action when you click/type on the page</li>
                <li>modify HTML or CSS content. this includes adding/changing/removing content or how it looks</li>
                <li>redirect you to a new page</li>
                <li>add, modify, and delete cookies</li>
                <li>make web requests to servers, and do stuff with the responses</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>example</h2>

            <p>the javascript on this page will track your mouse clicks and keystrokes. it'll tell you the coordinates
            of the last place on the page you clicked, the last key you pressed, and it'll change the background colour
            every time you click or type.</p>

            <div id="demo-div">
                <p>your mouse is at: (x=<span id="mouse-x">n/a</span>, y=<span id="mouse-y">n/a</span>)</p>
                <p>you last clicked: (x=<span id="click-x">n/a</span>, y=<span id="click-y">n/a</span>)</p>
                <p>you last pressed: [<span id="key-pressed">n/a</span>]</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>what you need to know (as a hacker)</h2>

            <p>don't call it "java". java is a different programming language</p>

            <p>javascript has a lot of capabilities. it's hard to explain how to hack javascript without just saying
            "learn how to code". but if you can at least learn some of the basics, it can definitely help a lot. if you
            can, look up what a "variable" is keep in mind that variables exist in pretty much every programming
            language; make sure your research is about javascript!</p>

            <p>javascript can be found inside <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags. often (but not always), the tags will point to
            an external file that ends with <code>.js</code>. it can be helpful to read those files!</p>

            <p>is there an easy way to read and modify the javascript variables on the page? hmm...<br>

            <h2>thank you for coming to my ted talk</h2>

            <p>alright. that's enough of me talking. let's get hacking!</p>

            <p>let's get back to the present day so we can start hunting for flags!</p>
