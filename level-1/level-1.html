            <h2>a story about magic</h2>

            <p>when i was</p>
            <p>a young girl</p>
            <p>my father</p>
            <p>took me into the city</p>
            <p>to see a marching band</p>

            <p>and i stood there in the city square, as the band passed by. the crowd must've been at least a few
            hundred people, all cheering as the band marched on. quite frankly, i dont remember which band it was, or
            for what occasion they were performing. i was just happy to see such a large spectacle right before my very
            own eyes</p>

            <p>eventually, the festivities were over, and life on the streets of the city returned to normal. even after
            the band had long passed, the streets were filled with people going about their daily lives. on the corner
            of the city square, a magician stood at the corner, standing alone at a makeshift table covered in a black
            velvet cloth. he wore a top hat and a tailcoat, and he had a rather full mustache that was curled at both
            ends</p>

            <p>he asked me if i wanted to see a magic trick, and i, being a young excitable girl, happily obliged. from
            underneath the tablecloth, he procured a golden birdcage. it housed a white dove, which cooed as its cage
            was lifted and gently placed onto the table</p>

            <p>the magician allowed me to observe the bird. its feathers were pure white, and its eyes as dark as
            obsidian. it sat on a small wooden perch that ran horizontally across the cage. below it sat a tidy nest of
            twigs and grass, almost as if it formed a nest. the magician assured me that the dove was, indeed, real. i,
            of course, had no doubts to its authenticity. to see such a beautiful creature move on its own before my
            eyes, it was so intricate that i was certain it could not have been faked</p>

            <p>as my eyes were fixed on the dove, the magician took out a bright red satin cloth, which he promptly
            redirected my attention to. he again allowed me to observe the cloth. it was an elegantly piece of fabric,
            with the threads so finely woven you could not see the individual strands. the cloth formed a singular
            square sheet, a bit less than a square meter in area. i made sure to check both sides; there were no holes
            or pockets to be found.</p>

            <p>"now young lady," he said to me, "have you fully examined the things i have shown you thus far?"</p>

            <p>"yes sir", i replied</p>

            <p>"and are you assured, based on your observations, that there are no gimmicks here? that what i am
            presenting you with involves no foul fakery, no contraptions of cheats, no devices of deceivers, or tools
            of tricksters?"</p>

            <p>"why yes, sir," i said again</p>

            <p>"then watch closely, my dear, and fix your eyes on the dove. for i will make it vanish, using my powers
            from above!"</p>

            <p>he gently cloaked the cage with the red satin cloth. the fabric fell smooth over the dome-shaped top, and
            it gracefully gathered in small ruffles around the cylindrical base. from a pocket inside his coat, he
            removed a wand, which he elegantly circled over the cloaked cage. he chanted a spell, the words which i
            could not understand, the sounds of which i had never heard before</p>

            <p>he then directed me, "now, if you would kindly place your hands on two corners of the sheet." i followed
            as i was instructed.</p>

            <p>"then on the count of three, i need you to pull the cloth away as quickly as you are capable. do you
            understand?"</p>

            <p>"yes", i answered slightly nervously</p>

            <p>"then are you ready?" he asked</p>

            <p>"yes sir", i confirmed</p>

            <p>"now on my count", he directed</p>

            <p>"one."</p>
            <p>"two..."</p>
            <p>"three!" <span style="color: #111111;">CybOrg{this_can_be_found_by_selecting_with_your_MOUSE}</span></p>

            <p>i yanked down on the cloth as hard as i could. and as i gazed at the location where the cloth i had been
            holding had just been, my eyes widened at what had just conspired</p>

            <p>the dove was gone. the golden cage remained, but the dove was nowhere to be seen</p>

            <p>i looked up at the magician in amazement. i asked him how the magic worked, and where the dove had
            went</p>

            <p>"now now, my dear child," he said in a soft voice. "i regret to tell you that there is no such thing as
            magic. only mere illusions. that bird is not truly gone, no. it is still there"</p>

            <p>"but i cant see it!"</p>

            <p>"yes that is true. but that which we can see is not all that there is"</p>

            <p>"then what happened to the bird?" i asked politely</p>

            <p>"it has merely changed colour. despite still being here in our midst, our eyes are unable to perceive it,
            as it blends into the environment surrounding it"</p>

            <p>"then it is still there?"</p>

            <p>"indeed", he responded confidently</p>

            <p>"then how am i to see what obscures itself into the darkness?" i questioned him</p>

            <p>slowly, he explained to me, "our eyes have limitations, but we are not blind to what we cannot see. you
            must secure the assistance of a particular creature. it is not a large, but small. a creature of the night,
            with a long tail, which can incite fear in even the largest of animals"</p>

            <p>"like an elephant?" i ask</p>

            <p>"hmm yes. correct."</p>

            <p>i sat there on the plaza corner, confused as to what he meant. soon, my father told me it was time to go,
            and i left the magician after he bid me a kind farewell. to this day, i am still unsure of what he meant. i
            never saw him again, and i never had the chance to ask him further</p>

            <!--
                is this story real? of course not! i literally made it up

                did i start out by making a bad MCR reference? absolutely!

                the story is meant to guide you to find the first flag. you can just read it in plaintext here, but
                you're meant to be able to find it without looking at any code

                seriously, if you havent already found the first flag ("story time"), you might feel like the flag
                hunting experience is more enjoyable if you find the first two flags without reading any code. otherwise
                it's too easy. (or not. it's really up to you)
